# Ventricular Segmentation in Hydrocephalus Using Deep Learning

**Running Title**: Ventricular Volume and Width Quantification using Deep Convolutional Networks Incorporated in a Graphical User Interface  

---

## 🧠 Overview

This project provides a fully automated pipeline for the detection and segmentation of brain ventricular subregions, developed to assist in the evaluation and monitoring of **hydrocephalus**.

Target structures include:
- Frontal, temporal, and posterior horns  
- Body of the lateral ventricles  
- Atrium (left and right)  
- Third and fourth ventricles

All models are integrated into a **standalone graphical interface**, built with **PyQt** and packaged as a `.exe` for Windows.

## 🖥️ GUI (.exe) – Download & Use

A simple **Windows application** is available. No installation or coding required.

### 👉 [**Download the GUI (.exe)**]([https://your-download-link.com](https://owncloud.damutten.ch/s/Cra7SEfM62nY2sZ))

### Steps:
1. Run the executable
2. Click **"Analyze Ventricles"**  
3. Select a folder containing your DICOM input scans
